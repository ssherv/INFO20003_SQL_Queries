<b>Context:</b>
This assignment draws inspiration from the Augmented Reality game Pokemon GO. Users can move around Melbourne, capturing virtual creatures called Phonemon (Phone Monsters). The Phonemon are superimposed onto the physical world by locating them at points on the map and visualiging them via the app. The database records information about users, information about Phonemon and information about in-app purchases (all in different tables). 

<b>Topics of focus:</b>
Query design and execution to return specific rows from the data model. Queries were run in MySQL Workbench.
